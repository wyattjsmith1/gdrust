Contributions are always welcome! In general, there are a few ways to contribute:

1. Filing bugs
2. Making suggestions
3. Create PRs

### Filing Bugs
If you find a bug, please let me know. I make bugs a priority. When filing an issue,
please choose the appropriate issue template and include a sample as well as what you
think the expected output should be. If the issue involves the editor, a screenshot of
Godot would be great.

### Making Suggestions
This project will hopefully get better over time, and that starts with proposals. In 
general, please ensure proposals follow this project's philosophy of improving 90% of
use cases. We are trying to keep the syntax as close to GdScript as possible and are
favoring readability over supporting 100% of cases.

### Creating PRs
PRs are always welcome. If you are making a PR to resolve a specific issue, please link 
to that issue. If you are adding a new feature, please consider filing an issue before 
you implement the change so it can be discussed by the community.
